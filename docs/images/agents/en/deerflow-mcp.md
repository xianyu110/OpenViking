DeerFlow can connect to OpenViking through an MCP Server. MCP integration lets DeerFlow agents actively search, read, and use memories and knowledge from OpenViking while executing tasks.

## Step 1: Configure OpenViking credentials

Edit the `.env` file in the DeerFlow project root and add the OpenViking USER API Key:

```bash
OPENVIKING_API_KEY=[TODO]your-api-key
```

## Step 2: Create an MCP configuration file

Copy `extensions_config.example.json` to `extensions_config.json` in the project root. DeerFlow uses this file to load MCP Servers:

```bash
cp extensions_config.example.json extensions_config.json
```

## Step 3: Configure the OpenViking MCP Server

Open `extensions_config.json` in the project root and add OpenViking under `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openviking": {
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "http",
      "url": "[TODO]openviking-base-url/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "$OPENVIKING_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Restart DeerFlow

Save `.env` and `extensions_config.json`, then restart DeerFlow:

```bash
make dev
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| DeerFlow does not load the OpenViking MCP Server after startup | `extensions_config.json` is missing, malformed, or `enabled` is not set to `true` | Check `mcpServers.openviking` and make sure the JSON format is valid |
| OpenViking MCP tools do not appear in the Agent tool list | The MCP configuration did not take effect, or the service was not restarted | Save the configuration and restart DeerFlow, or refresh the MCP configuration cache |
| Calling OpenViking MCP tools fails with 401 or 403 | API Key is missing, incorrect, or unauthorized | Check whether `OPENVIKING_API_KEY` is correctly set in `.env` and confirm the header uses `X-API-Key` |
| MCP Server connection fails | The `url` is incorrect, or DeerFlow Gateway cannot access the OpenViking MCP Server | Check the OpenViking MCP Server address, network connectivity, and Docker network configuration |
| Old credentials are still used after modifying `.env` | Environment variables were not reloaded, or the MCP configuration cache was not refreshed | Restart DeerFlow, or call `/api/mcp/cache/reset` to refresh the cache |
| Agent does not actively call OpenViking tools | MCP tools are invoked by the model on demand and are not an automatic memory backend | Explicitly ask the Agent to use OpenViking tools in the prompt, or use MemoryManager integration for automatic recall |
